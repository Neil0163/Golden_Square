1. Describe the Problem
Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

As a user
So that I can keep track of my tasks
I want to check if a text includes the string #TODO.

2. Design the Function Signature
Include the name of the function, its parameters, return value, and side effects.

def task_tracker(text):
    parameters:
            A human readable string
    return: 
            boolen True or False 

3. Create Examples as Tests
Make a list of examples of what the function will take and return.


def find_todo(text):
def test_todo_in_text():  
def test_todo_in_mixed_case():
def test_empty_text():
def test_multiple_todos():
    



4. Implement the Behaviour
After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
